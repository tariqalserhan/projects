// The match expression is wrong is a couple ways. 
// First, it doesn't consider all the possible choices for color, which is of type Colors. Fix this by either using a wildcard pattern, or match each of the other possibilities for the enum.
// Second, one of the match arms does not match the type of the other arms. Make it match.
// Third, there is no semicolon at the end;
